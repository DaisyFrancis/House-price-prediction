House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. It utilizes linear regression and evaluates model accuracy using metrics such as R-squared error and mean absolute error. The project provides insights into training and testing data predictions through visualizations.

Features:
Loads the Boston Housing dataset and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame
Splits the data into training and test sets
Creates a linear regression model and trains it on the training data
Evaluates model accuracy using R-squared error and mean absolute error
Visualizes the predicted prices against actual prices for both training and test data
